Tim greatly enjoyed conducting his train around every day, and even though he had relatively poor pay, all was well in Tim's world. There was only one issue; Tim was a flat out *awful* conductor. He reduced the overall efficiency of all of the trains nearly every day by screwing up his timing, causing other trains to have to wait on him. \\n\\nTim's conducting got worse and worse as time went on. One day, Tim decided to try and eat his lunch while doing his job. Seeing as he could hardly work while focused, this was a terrible idea, but Tim decided to do it anyway. This was a mistake. Another train, hurtling at his train at great speed, was scheduled to pass through the area that Tim was currently in. It was Tim's responsibility to yield to the other train to prevent a crash. Unbeknownst to the other conductor, Tim was unaware that the other train was coming, so Tim plowed on in his train, not a care in the world. Biting into the sandwich his wife had packed, Tim's eyes closed to savor the taste. The other train began to cross in front of him, but seeing as Tim's eyes were closed, Tim did not see the train, and didn't stop. The two collided, the screeching of metal against metal combined with the crashing as the two trains were flung off of their tracks.\\n\\nTim was fired on the spot. Devastated, Tim went home to his wife. Her kind, loving smile upon seeing him made his insides melt, and it was in that moment Tim realized he couldn't bear to break the news to her. Acting as though nothing was wrong, Tim left the next day as if going to work, but instead drank at a nearby pub the entire day. This continued for weeks until Tim ran out of money.
